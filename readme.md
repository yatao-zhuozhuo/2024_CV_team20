Steel detection plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and safety of steel products, which are widely used across various industries. This study investigates an enhanced approach to steel defect detection using the Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) architecture. The traditional Faster R-CNN model is modified by incorporating a dual-channel backbone, where the second channel includes four distinct image enhancement techniques: CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), LBP (Local Binary Pattern), FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), and Sobel filtering. These enhancements aim to provide additional feature representations that may improve the detection of subtle defects in steel surfaces. Additionally, the loss function is modified through the use of focal loss, addressing class imbalance. The potential impact on the overall detection performance of these modifications is shown through experiments.
